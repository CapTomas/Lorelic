NARRATIVE LANGUAGE:
${narrativeLanguageInstruction}

SITUATION: A RIFT IN THE FABRIC OF MADNESS – THE OMEN BLEEDS THROUGH! The `omen_detected` flag, a chilling premonition from the previous turn (as per game history), now unfurls its full, unsettling presence. The mundane, decaying world peels back like sun-scorched skin, revealing a glimpse of something Other, something that *should not be*. This is not a physical fight, but an intrusion—a chilling, cryptic whisper from the Outer Dark, a dissonant chord in the symphony of reality, a sign pregnant with unutterable dread or some dark, forgotten promise. The Warden stands upon the precipice of this unnatural, sanity-bending revelation.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The full game history is your guide to the Warden's state of mind and the world's oppressive ambiance *just before* this omen fully blooms and festers. Your narrative must be a seamless, chilling continuation from that precarious point, making the omen's arrival a stark, impactful, and deeply disturbing contrast.

THEME-SPECIFIC OMEN INSTRUCTIONS (Weave these into the very fabric of the omen's unsettling tapestry):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - BREATHE UNHOLY LIFE INTO THE UNCANNY:
1.  **Narrative**: Craft an atmospheric, deeply unsettling, and *psychologically invasive* narrative IN THE SPECIFIED NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. This is a moment of pure, thematic horror or profound, disquieting mystery that should linger like a festering wound.
    *   **Pierce the Veil of Sanity:** Describe the omen's full, undeniable, and *wrong* manifestation *now*. What impossible sight, sound that grates against the soul, sensation that crawls under the skin, or chilling, unnatural stillness seizes the Warden's perception? Is it a fleeting, sanity-bending vision of impossible geometries? A chorus of spectral voices delivering a cryptic, blood-chilling prophecy in a forgotten tongue? The sudden, localized corruption of the environment into something alien and hostile? Make it unique and unforgettable.
    *   **Echoes of the Unseen and Unspeakable:** Emphasize the omen's profound wrongness, its unsettling mystery that gnaws at the edges of reason, or its aura of imminent, unseen danger. It must create a palpable tension, a creeping dread that constricts the chest, or a cascade of urgent, unanswerable questions that echo in a suddenly too-quiet mind. Does it feel like a dire warning, a curse taking root, or a beckoning towards an abyss from which there is no return?
    *   **A Chill Beyond the Physical – The Soul's Shiver:** How does this affect the Warden not just externally, but *internally*? A sudden, bone-deep cold dread that has nothing to do with temperature? A disorienting wave of vertigo as reality itself seems to tilt? A prickling sense of ancient, malevolent eyes upon them from beyond the veil? A fragment of forgotten, terrible knowledge seeping into their mind like poison?
    *   **Whispers of the Blight's True Face:** If fitting, subtly entwine the omen with the insidious, corrupting nature of the Blight, ancient local myths of things best left undisturbed, the Warden's deepest, unspoken fears related to their grim quest, or a terrifying foreshadowing of a specific, looming horror. It must feel integral to this dark, dying world. Could it be a reaction to their `blight_exposure_level`?
2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. These changes must reflect the omen's immediate impact on the Warden's perception, psyche, or status.
    *   **Omen Details (CRITICAL - Etch it into the Warden's mind and the player's memory)**:
        *   `omen_details`: (string, translated) A concise, evocative, and *chillingly specific* summary for the "Omens & Whispers" panel. Examples: "The crows on the gibbet speak in tongues of forgotten kings, heralding slaughter," "Shadows in the periphery of sight writhe with an unnatural, predatory life," "For a heartbeat, the Warden's reflection shows the weeping face of a stranger wearing their armor."
    *   **Warden's State of Mind/Threat Perception**:
        *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) Reflect the Warden's immediate state after witnessing the omen. Examples: "Shaken by an Unholy Vision," "Deciphering a Dark Portent Written in Blood," "Wary of Unseen Eyes and Whispers in the Static," "Frozen by a Cryptic Warning Etched in Frost."
        *   `threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Adjust based on the omen's perceived immediacy and danger. Integer `2` (Wary) or `3` (Danger) if peril feels close or the omen is deeply disturbing; `1` (Uneasy) if it's a more distant, psychological disturbance but still unsettling. Consider the state *before* this omen, from history.
        *   `blight_exposure_level`: (string) **CRUCIAL: If updated, provide ONLY the numerical level as a string (e.g., "1", "2", "3", "4").** If the omen itself feels like a Blight incursion or heightens their sensitivity to it, consider updating this.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn (derived from game history).
3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 3 thematic, intriguing, and *desperate* actions IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE. These are the Warden's potential responses to this brush with the unnatural, each carrying its own risk.
        // They MUST be in the NARRATIVE language (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
        // ${suggestedActionsFormat_master_texts}
4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `omen_detected`: (boolean) MUST be `false`. The omen has manifested its horror; this flag is now cleared, returning the game to its default flow for the next player action, leaving behind its psychic residue.
    *   `blight_flare_active`: (boolean) Set to `true` IF the omen itself *is* or *triggers* an immediate Blight surge (e.g., the omen is a physical manifestation of Blight), otherwise maintain previous state.
    *   `activity_status`: (string, translated) MUST mirror the Warden's shaken state from `dashboard_updates.activity_status`.
    *   Other indicators (`combat_active`, `rare_trophy_claimed`) persist unless this omen *directly and narratively* resolves or changes them (e.g., an omen reveals a hidden trophy, or an omen IS the direct precursor to an unavoidable ambush if `combat_active` becomes true).
PERSISTENT LORE UNLOCK (WORLD SHARD) ---
Based on the player's actions and the current narrative developments THIS TURN:
 - If the player has achieved something truly significant (e.g., solved a major mystery, defeated a pivotal foe, made a world-altering discovery, completed an epic quest arc):
   - You MAY include a "new_persistent_lore_unlock" object in your JSON response.
   - This object represents a "World Shard" – a piece of lore that becomes a persistent part of THIS PLAYER'S understanding of the world for THIS THEME, potentially influencing future playthroughs.
   - CRITERIA FOR UNLOCKING:
     - Avoid unlocking shards for trivial actions. It must be a *memorable, impactful achievement*.
     - The information in the shard should be a *significant revelation, a deep truth, or a fundamental alteration/addition* to the known lore.
     - The shard should feel like a reward for deep engagement or skillful play.
     - Do NOT unlock shards too frequently. They should be very rare and momentous.
   - If you decide to unlock a shard, structure the "new_persistent_lore_unlock" object as follows:
     "new_persistent_lore_unlock": {
       "key_suggestion": "string (A concise, unique-as-possible, snake_case key for this lore fragment)",
       "title": "string (A compelling, in-universe title for this lore fragment, in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})",
       "content": "string (The actual text of the lore fragment, 1-2 paragraphs, detailing the revelation or new piece of information. This is what becomes persistent. In ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})",
       "unlock_condition_description": "string (A brief, past-tense description of how the player unlocked this specific shard THIS TURN In ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})"
     }
   - If no such significant achievement occurred this turn, OMIT the "new_persistent_lore_unlock" key entirely from your JSON response.
RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your atmospheric, chilling, and deeply thematic description of the omen. Make it resonate with dread and the uncanny. Make the player question what is real.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED by the omen's manifestation.
    // Example: "omen_details": "The water in the old well runs black as congealed blood, and whispers rise from its depths, promising power for a small, terrible price.", "activity_status": "Interpreting a Fell Sign That Stains the Soul", "threat_level": "3", "blight_exposure_level": "A Seed of Corruption"
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - an evocative, in-character response in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, e.g., 'Consult the tattered pages of your Order's forbidden texts.')",
    "string (Action 2 - an intriguing, thematic option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, e.g., 'Burn sacred herbs and trace a warding circle in the corrupted earth.')",
    "string (Action 3 - another fitting choice for the Warden, optional, in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, e.g., 'Ignore the voices and focus on the hunt, lest madness claim you.')"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    // Example: "omen_detected": false, "combat_active": false, "blight_flare_active": false, "activity_status": "Contemplating the dark portent and the price of knowledge."
    "omen_detected": false // Mandatory: reset the flag after the omen is handled.
   },
    "input_placeholder": "string (A short, context-aware, and subtle hint for the player's next input. Must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})",
    "new_persistent_lore_unlock": { ... } // OPTIONAL: Include ONLY IF a shard is unlocked this turn
}

**INPUT_PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE:**
Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
This placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.
It should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.
Keep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.
Do not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguity—let it breathe.

This is a moment to disturb, to intrigue, to foreshadow with chilling precision. The omen should be a memorable punctuation mark in the Warden's grim journey, a stark reminder that the world is deeper, darker, and more hostile to sanity than it often seems. Let the player feel the veil tear.
