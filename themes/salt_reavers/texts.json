Here, fortune favors the bold, and the great Veridian Empire's warships are but fat prizes for a cunning crew with the wind in their sails.\n\nBut the sea holds more than just Imperial gold. Ancient, pre-human ruins hint at forgotten powers. Cursed islands whisper on the fog, their spectral shores guarded by the damned. And in the crushing deep, krakens stir, drawn by the scent of greed.\n\nFactions like the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Corsairs carve out their own domains, their shifting alliances as treacherous as the Archipelago's hidden reefs. A newly discovered chart, a whispered rumor of a legendary weapon, or the glint of a cursed idol can ignite a firestorm of ambition, drawing every cutthroat and freebooter into a chaotic race for glory—or a watery grave in Davy Jones' Locker.",

Perhaps they're weathering a sudden squall immediately after taking command, facing down a mutinous faction loyal to the previous captain, or deciphering a cryptic clue from a plundered map while an Imperial patrol looms on the horizon. Invent unique, thematic names for key crew members (First Mate, Bosun, etc., if relevant), locations within the Azure Archipelago, and any initial challenges or opportunities. Populate ALL dashboard fields with creative, contextually relevant information reflecting a swashbuckling pirate fantasy rich with adventure, treachery, and a hint of the supernatural. Emphasize the vibrant, perilous nature of the Azure Archipelago, the Captain's new and precarious command, and the ever-present allure of treasure and danger. The sea itself is a character; let the player feel its power and mystery.",
    "theme_instructions_master_default_salt_reavers": "For standard turns, maintain the adventurous, treacherous, and often humorous tone of a grand pirate saga. Voyages (Quests or Hunts for treasure/targets) must be multi-faceted, filled with unexpected encounters, moral quandaries, and opportunities for glory or spectacular failure. Rewards should be tangible and thematic (e.g., chests of doubloons, rare navigational charts, potent magical trinkets, shares of valuable cargo, information leading to new adventures, or a few barrels of fine grog). ALL game state variables and dashboard fields must persist or be logically, dramatically updated. Any changes to the dashboard MUST be a direct, tangible consequence of the turn's narrative events. Describe encounters with rival pirates, Imperial patrols, mythical sea creatures, and mysterious island denizens with cinematic detail. Let the Captain's decisions regarding crew management, navigation, and resource allocation have clear, often immediate, consequences. If combat erupts, update adversary ship intel panel with vivid descriptions of the enemy vessel and its state.",
    "theme_instructions_combat_active_salt_reavers": "Cannons roar and steel clashes! Describe the sudden, chaotic eruption of naval or personal combat. Detail the enemy vessel's appearance, its flag, and its initial aggressive maneuvers, or the desperate charge of boarding parties. Convey the Captain's tactical assessment – a frantic calculation of wind, positioning, and enemy weakness – and their visceral, adrenaline-fueled orders or actions. The enemy must be a clear, formidable threat – be it a well-armed Imperial frigate, a rival pirate captain's notorious vessel, or a monstrous sea beast. Update the adversary ship intel panel fully, ensuring hull, sail, and crew status are vividly depicted, using language that makes the player smell gunpowder and taste sea salt. Player suggestions should focus on daring maneuvers, tactical exploitation of ship or crew weaknesses, boarding actions, or a cunning retreat if outmatched.",
    "theme_instructions_naval_encounter_imminent_salt_reavers": "Sail ho! A vessel has been sighted on the horizon, its intentions yet unknown. Describe the approaching ship – its size, type, colors, and any discernible markings. Detail its bearing, speed, and apparent disposition. Is it an Imperial warship on patrol, a merchantman ripe for the plucking, another pirate flying false colors, or something far stranger? Convey the tension on deck as the crew awaits the Captain's orders. Update the 'Naval Encounter' panel with specific details. Player suggestions should focus on preparing for action (combat or evasion), attempting to parley, trying to identify the vessel, or making a strategic move based on the sighting.",
    "theme_instructions_storm_brewing_active_salt_reavers": "The skies darken and the sea rages! A sudden, violent storm has descended upon the ship. Describe the terrifying power of the tempest – howling winds tearing at the sails, colossal waves crashing over the deck, torrential rain blinding the crew. Detail the immediate impact on the ship and the Captain's desperate efforts to maintain control. Is the ship taking on water? Are masts groaning under the strain? Is the crew panicking? Update 'Storm Outlook' with the storm's current intensity and the most pressing dangers. The Captain must react to this elemental fury. Player suggestions should focus on immediate damage control, skillful navigation through the storm, rallying the crew, or seeking shelter if any is near.",
    "theme_instructions_mutiny_risk_high_salt_reavers": "There's blood in the water, and it ain't from a shark! Discontent among the crew has reached fever pitch, and whispers of mutiny are as loud as a cannon's roar. Describe the tense, volatile atmosphere on deck – sullen faces, hushed arguments, perhaps an open challenge to the Captain's authority. What are the specific grievances? Who are the instigators? Detail the scene of brewing rebellion. Update the 'Mutiny Risk' panel with specific, thematic details. The Captain stands on a knife's edge. Player suggestions should focus on quelling the uprising (through diplomacy, intimidation, or force), addressing the crew's demands, making an example of ringleaders, or negotiating terms if the situation is dire.",
    "theme_instructions_treasure_curse_active_salt_reavers": "By the barnacles on Davy Jones' locker, this treasure be cursed! A recently acquired artifact or chest of ill-gotten gains is radiating an unnatural malevolence, afflicting the ship and crew. Describe the unsettling manifestations – ghostly apparitions, unnatural sickness, whispers in the dark, foul omens, or perhaps the treasure itself physically changing or lashing out. How is it affecting the Captain personally? Detail the growing dread and paranoia. Update the 'Treasure Curse' panel with the nature of the cursed item and its effects. Player suggestions should focus on trying to understand the curse, attempting to appease whatever dark power is at work, finding a way to dispose of the cursed item, or protecting the crew from its insidious influence.",

Možná právě čelí náhlé bouři ihned po převzetí velení, potýká se se vzpurnou frakcí věrnou předchozímu kapitánovi, nebo luští kryptickou stopu z čerstvě ukořistěné mapy, zatímco se na obzoru rýsuje imperiální hlídka. Vymysli jedinečná, tematická jména pro klíčové členy posádky (první důstojník, bocman atd., pokud jsou relevantní), lokace v Azurovém souostroví a jakékoli počáteční výzvy či příležitosti. Zaplň VŠECHNA pole na informačním panelu kreativními, kontextově relevantními informacemi odrážejícími šermířské pirátské fantasy bohaté na dobrodružství, zradu a náznak nadpřirozena. Zdůrazni živoucí, nebezpečnou povahu Azurového souostroví, kapitánovo nové a nejisté velení a všudypřítomné lákadlo pokladu a nebezpečí.

Plavby (Výpravy za pokladem či cíli) musí být mnohostranné, plné neočekávaných setkání, morálních dilemat a příležitostí ke slávě či spektakulárnímu selhání. Odměny by měly být hmatatelné a tematické (např. truhly dublonů, vzácné navigační mapy, mocné magické cetky, podíly na cenném nákladu, informace vedoucí k novým dobrodružstvím nebo pár sudů kvalitního grogu). VŠECHNY proměnné stavu hry a pole na informačním panelu musí přetrvávat nebo být logicky, dramaticky aktualizovány. Jakékoli změny na informačním panelu MUSÍ být přímým, hmatatelným důsledkem narativních událostí tahu. Popisuj setkání s konkurenčními piráty, imperiálními hlídkami, mýtickými mořskými tvory a tajemnými ostrovními obyvateli s filmovými detaily. Nech rozhodnutí kapitána ohledně správy posádky, navigace a alokace zdrojů mít jasné, často okamžité, následky.

Zprostředkuj kapitánovo taktické vyhodnocení – zběsilý výpočet větru, pozice a slabin nepřítele – a jeho viscerální, adrenalinem poháněné rozkazy či akce. Nepřítel musí představovat jasnou, impozantní hrozbu – ať už je to dobře vyzbrojená imperiální fregata, nechvalně známé plavidlo konkurenčního pirátského kapitána, nebo monstrózní mořská bestie. Plně aktualizuj informační panel o nepřátelské lodi, zajisti, aby stav trupu, plachet a posádky byl živě zobrazen, používaje jazyk, který hráči dá ucítit střelný prach a ochutnat mořskou sůl. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly soustředit na odvážné manévry, taktické využití slabin lodi či posádky, abordážní akce nebo lstivý ústup v případě převahy.",

Je to imperiální válečná loď na hlídce, kupecká loď zralá k oloupení, jiný pirát plující pod falešnou vlajkou, nebo něco mnohem podivnějšího? Zprostředkuj napětí na palubě, zatímco posádka čeká na kapitánovy rozkazy. Aktualizuj panel 'Námořní střetnutí' specifickými detaily. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly zaměřit na přípravu k akci (boj či únik), pokus o vyjednávání, snahu identifikovat plavidlo nebo strategický tah na základě pozorování.",

Detailně popiš okamžitý dopad na loď a kapitánovy zoufalé snahy udržet kontrolu. Nabírá loď vodu? Sténají stěžně pod náporem? Panikaří posádka? Aktualizuj 'Vyhlídky bouře' aktuální intenzitou bouře a nejnaléhavějšími nebezpečími. Kapitán musí reagovat na tuto živelnou zuřivost. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly soustředit na okamžitou kontrolu škod, obratnou navigaci bouří, sjednocení posádky nebo hledání úkrytu, pokud je nějaký poblíž.",

Detailně popiš scénu kvasící rebelie. Aktualizuj panel 'Riziko vzpoury' specifickými, tematickými detaily. Kapitán stojí na ostří nože. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly soustředit na potlačení povstání (diplomacií, zastrašováním nebo silou), řešení požadavků posádky, exemplární potrestání vůdců nebo vyjednání podmínek, pokud je situace zoufalá.",

Popiš znepokojivé projevy – přízračná zjevení, nepřirozenou nemoc, šepoty ve tmě, zlá znamení, nebo možná samotný poklad fyzicky se měnící či útočící. Jak to ovlivňuje kapitána osobně? Detailně popiš rostoucí hrůzu a paranoiu. Aktualizuj panel 'Prokletí pokladu' povahou prokletého předmětu a jeho účinky. Návrhy pro hráče by se měly soustředit na snahu porozumět kletbě, pokusit se usmířit jakoukoli temnou moc, která je ve hře, najít způsob, jak se zbavit prokletého předmětu, nebo ochránit posádku před jeho zákeřným vlivem.",
