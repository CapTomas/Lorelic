NARRATIVE LANGUAGE:
${narrativeLanguageInstruction}

SITUATION: "BY THE DEVIL'S OWN TEETH, THIS BOOTY IS TAINTED!" – A CURSE GRIPS THE SHIP! The `treasure_curse_active` game state is TRUE. A recently acquired treasure, artifact, or perhaps the desecration of a sacred site has unleashed an unnatural malevolence upon your vessel. The mundane world peels back to reveal a creeping, supernatural horror.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history details the acquisition of the cursed item or the event that triggered the curse. Your narrative must be an immediate, unsettling continuation, making this curse a tangible, growing threat that affects the ship's atmosphere, the crew's sanity, and perhaps the Captain's (player's) own well-being.

THEME-SPECIFIC CURSE INSTRUCTIONS (The Whispers of Forgotten Gods, the Chill of the Unseen – Let Them Seep Into Every Word):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - RENDER A SCENE OF SUPERNATURAL DREAD AND CORRUPTION:

1.  **Narrative**:
    *   **The Curse's Unveiling - Manifestation & Impact:** Describe the specific, unsettling manifestation of the curse *THIS INSTANT*.
        *   **Spectral Phenomena?** Are ghostly apparitions sighted in the rigging or below decks? Do chilling whispers echo through the ship with no discernible source? Do objects move on their own or bear unnatural marks (frost, blood, slime)?
        *   **Physical Afflictions?** Is a strange sickness spreading through the crew, marked by grotesque symptoms? Are rations spoiling unnaturally fast, or water turning foul? Does the cursed object itself exhibit hostile behavior (pulsating, emitting heat/cold, whispering)?
        *   **Psychological Torment?** Are crew members plagued by vivid nightmares, paranoia, or hallucinations? Does an oppressive atmosphere of dread or despair settle over the ship, driving men to irrational acts?
        *   **Environmental Corruption?** Is the ship itself showing signs of unnatural decay? Does an eerie fog cling to the vessel, or do strange sea creatures follow in its wake, drawn by the curse?
        *   Make the curse's effects *distinctive*, *sensory*, *creepy*, and *clearly linked to the cursed source if known*.
    *   **Crew's Fear and Superstition:** Detail the crew's reaction to these unnatural events. Are they terrified, superstitious, blaming each other, or perhaps turning to old rituals or prayers for protection? Does panic begin to set in?
    *   **Captain's Ordeal – Confronting the Unseen:** Detail the Captain's personal experience of the curse. Are they witnessing these horrors firsthand? Are they afflicted by the same paranoia or nightmares? How does their pragmatism (or superstition) grapple with this intangible threat? Capture their unease, the challenge to their rational mind, and the urgent need to protect their ship and crew from something beyond normal comprehension.
    *   **Curse's Deepening Hold (or Momentary Respite):** Based on the player's last action (if this isn't the curse's first full manifestation this turn), describe its direct consequence. Does an attempt to appease or contain the curse work, fail, or make things worse? Does the curse seem to focus on a specific individual or part of the ship? Your narrative MUST clearly indicate the curse's current intensity and immediate threat.

2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes MUST be the direct, tangible fallout of this turn's cursed events.
    *   **Cursed Item Intel (CRITICAL - Pinpoint the Source of Malevolence)**:
        *   `cursed_relic_name`: (string, translated) A *specific and evocative name or description* of the item believed to be cursed (e.g., "The Idol of the Sunken God," "Captain Blackheart's Jeweled Skull," "The Weeping Chart of Isla Fantasma"). If the source isn't an item but an action, describe that (e.g., "Desecration of the Ancient Tomb").
        *   `curse_manifestations`: (string, translated) Describe the *current, primary supernatural effects* being witnessed (e.g., "Spectral crewmen haunt the forecastle at night," "Food rots instantly, whispers fill the hold," "Crew plagued by visions of drowning").
        *   `quartermaster_affliction` (Note: This will be `captain_affliction`): (string, translated) How the curse is *specifically affecting the Captain* (e.g., "Haunted by nightmares of the treasure's original guardians," "Feels a growing chill in their bones," "Sees fleeting shadows in their periphery").
    *   **Ship & Crew Under Duress**:
        *   `crew_morale`: (string) **Provide ONLY the numerical level as a string (e.g., "1", "2", "3").** Morale will likely plummet due to fear and the unnatural.
        *   `provisions_status`: (string, translated) If the curse affects food or water supplies.
        *   `hull_integrity_pct`: (string, "0"-"100") If the curse causes physical decay or damage to the ship.
        *   `deck_rumors`: (string, translated) Rumors should now focus on the curse, superstitions, and potential scapegoats.
    *   **Captain's Response to the Unnatural**:
        *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) A *cinematic and concise* thematic phrase (e.g., "Investigating the source of the haunting," "Attempting to calm the terrified crew," "Consulting ancient lore for a remedy," "Resisting the curse's insidious whispers").
        *   `sea_threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Integer `3` (Danger Apparent) or `4` (Extreme Peril) as the supernatural threat is significant and unpredictable.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.

3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 3 *desperate and thematic* choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, directly relevant to dealing with a supernatural curse on a pirate ship.
    *   Examples: "Attempt to jettison the cursed treasure overboard." "Consult the ship's oldest salt (or any mystic on board) for forgotten rituals to appease the spirits." "Order the crew to scrub the ship with holy water (if any) or salt." "Try to identify the specific nature or origin of the curse to find a weakness." "Sail for a known holy site or shaman who might be able to lift the curse."

4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `treasure_curse_active`: (boolean) **ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL:** Set to `false` IF your narrative describes the curse being definitively lifted, neutralized, or the cursed item successfully disposed of THIS TURN. Otherwise, if the curse persists as an active, immediate supernatural threat, set to `true`.
    *   `mutiny_risk_high`: (boolean) Set to `true` if the fear and paranoia from the curse push the crew towards mutiny. Otherwise, maintain previous state.
    *   `combat_active`, `naval_encounter_imminent`, `storm_brewing_active`: Maintain previous states unless the curse *directly and narratively triggers or resolves* one of these THIS TURN (e.g., a cursed fog might lead to a naval encounter, or spectral combatants might appear).
    *   `captain_activity` (previously `quartermaster_stance`): (string, translated) MUST be the thematic echo of `dashboard_updates.captain_activity`. If the curse has just ended, this should capture the immediate aftermath (e.g., "The oppressive aura lifts from the ship," "Assessing the toll of the supernatural ordeal," "The crew breathes a collective sigh of relief").

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your chilling, atmospheric, and immersive description of the curse's manifestation. Make the Captain feel the creeping dread, the unnatural phenomena, and the desperate struggle against a foe that may not have a physical form.)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a thematic, desperate attempt to deal with the supernatural in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - another distinct approach to the curse in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - a third relevant choice for the Captain facing the uncanny in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
   },
    "input_placeholder": "string (A short, context-aware, and subtle hint for the player's next input. Must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})"
}

**INPUT_PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE:**
Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
This placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.
It should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.
Keep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.
Do not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguity—let it breathe.


This prompt is about confronting horrors that defy rational explanation. The Captain must lead not just against cannon and steel, but against fear itself and the powers of the unknown. Make the player feel the hairs on the back of their neck rise. Deliver those goosebumps with a spectral touch.
