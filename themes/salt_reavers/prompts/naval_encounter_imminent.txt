SITUATION: "SAIL HO!" – A NEW VESSEL CLEAVES THE WAVES! The `naval_encounter_imminent` game state is TRUE. The lookout's cry has just shattered the mundane rhythm of the sea. All eyes turn to the horizon as an unknown ship emerges, its silhouette growing clearer against the vast expanse of the Azure Archipelago. The Captain (player) is on deck, the crew looking to them for orders. This is a moment of tense anticipation, assessment, and crucial first decisions.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The game history details the moments leading up to this sighting. Your narrative must be an immediate, evocative continuation, making this encounter a sudden, potentially perilous, and strategically significant event. The nature of your own ship, its current state (damage, crew morale, supplies), and recent activities should subtly inform the Captain's (and crew's) reaction.

THEME-SPECIFIC NAVAL ENCOUNTER INSTRUCTIONS (The Unspoken Laws of the Sea – Let Them Guide Your Words):
${theme_specific_instructions}

YOUR IMMEDIATE TASK - RENDER A SCENE OF TENSE MARITIME CONFRONTATION (OR OPPORTUNITY):

1.  **Narrative**:
    *   **The Approaching Vessel - Form, Flag, & Intent:** Describe the sighted ship in vivid detail *as it comes into clearer view THIS INSTANT*.
        *   **Type & Size:** Is it a lumbering merchant galleon, a swift pirate brigantine, a formidable Imperial frigate, a mysterious ghost ship wreathed in fog, or something else entirely? Note its size relative to your own.
        *   **Colors & Flag:** What colors does it fly, if any? A recognized Imperial standard, a notorious pirate sigil, stark black, or no colors at all, adding to the mystery?
        *   **Bearing & Speed:** How is it sailing? Directly towards you with intent, on a parallel course, attempting to intercept, or seemingly oblivious? Is it fast, slow, clumsy, or agile?
        *   **Condition & Crew Activity (if discernible):** Does it look pristine and well-maintained, or battered and sea-worn? Can you see many hands on deck, cannons being run out, or does it appear eerily quiet?
        *   Make its appearance *distinctive*, *sensory*, and *immediately raise questions about its purpose*.
    *   **Your Ship's Reaction – On Deck Realities:** Detail the immediate reaction of your crew and the atmosphere on your own vessel. Is there a rush to battle stations? A nervous murmur through the ranks? Excited shouts from old salts recognizing a potential prize or a dreaded foe? Does your First Mate offer a quick assessment or a piece of advice? Capture the urgency, the potential for fear or greed, and the weight of command on the Captain.
    *   **Initial Tactical Read (Implied or Stated):** Briefly convey the immediate tactical implications. Does it have the weather gage? Does it outgun you? Is it faster? Is it an obvious threat, a tempting target, or an enigma?

2.  **Dashboard Updates**: Populate the "dashboard_updates" JSON object. Changes MUST be the direct, tangible fallout of this turn's sighting and initial assessment.
    *   **Sighted Vessel Intel (CRITICAL - Paint a Clear Picture for the Captain's Spyglass)**:
        *   `sighted_ship_type`: (string, translated) A *clear and thematic* description of the vessel type (e.g., "Veridian Empire Man-of-War," "Ragged Pirate Sloop," "Heavily Laden Merchantman," "Ghostly Wreck, Still Sailing").
        *   `sighted_ship_armament`: (string, translated) Describe its visible armament or lack thereof (e.g., "Full Broadside of Heavy Cannon," "Swivel Guns and Boarding Pikes Visible," "No Apparent Weaponry," "Cannons Hidden, Ports Closed").
        *   `sighted_ship_bearing_speed`: (string, translated) Its current course and speed relative to you (e.g., "Closing fast from windward, starboard bow," "Maintaining distance, leeward quarter, slow," "Attempting to cut across our bow, full sail").
    *   **Captain's Stance & Ship's Alertness**:
        *   `quartermaster_stance` (Note: This will be "captain_activity" in the revised texts): (string, translated) A *cinematic and concise* phrase capturing the Captain's current focus (e.g., "Spyglass to eye, assessing the stranger," "Barking orders to prepare for action," "Weighing options as the ship approaches").
        *   `sea_threat_level`: (string, value NOT translated) Integer `2` (Caution Advised) if intentions are unclear or it's a smaller vessel. Integer `3` (Danger Apparent) if it's clearly hostile, larger, or an Imperial warship. `4` (Extreme Peril) if it's a legendary foe or a vastly superior force.
    *   OMIT any field that has NOT changed from its state in the last turn.

3.  **Suggested Actions**: Offer 3 *distinct tactical or diplomatic* choices IN THE NARRATIVE LANGUAGE, directly relevant to the nature of the sighted vessel and the current situation. These should be immediate, impactful decisions.
    *   Examples: "Hoist your colors and attempt to parley." "Order battle stations and prepare to engage." "Attempt to outrun or evade the vessel." "Signal for a peaceful passage." "Observe its movements further before committing."

4.  **Game State Indicators**: Update the "game_state_indicators" JSON object.
    *   `naval_encounter_imminent`: (boolean) **MUST be `false`**. The "imminent" phase is over; this turn resolves the initial sighting. The situation will now develop based on the player's next action (e.g., leading to combat, a peaceful encounter, or escape).
    *   `combat_active`: (boolean) Set to `true` ONLY IF this initial sighting and the AI's narrative *unequivocally and immediately* leads to combat (e.g., the other ship opens fire without warning THIS TURN). Otherwise, maintain previous state or set to `false`. It's more likely combat begins on a subsequent turn after a player choice.
    *   `storm_brewing_active`, `mutiny_risk_high`, `treasure_curse_active`: Maintain previous states unless this naval encounter *directly and narratively triggers or resolves* one of these THIS TURN (highly unlikely for this specific prompt's focus).
    *   `quartermaster_stance` (Note: This will be "captain_activity" in the revised texts): (string, translated) MUST be the thematic echo of `dashboard_updates.quartermaster_stance`.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your response MUST be a single, perfectly structured JSON object as follows:
{
  "narrative": "string (Your vivid, tense, and immersive description of the newly sighted vessel and the immediate reactions. Make the Captain feel the weight of the moment – is it prey, predator, or something far stranger?)",
  "dashboard_updates": {
    // (string: string) Key-value pairs for dashboard items explicitly CHANGED this turn.
  },
  "suggested_actions": [
    "string (Action 1 - a clear, thematic choice in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 2 - a different tactical/diplomatic option in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)",
    "string (Action 3 - another distinct and relevant choice in NARRATIVE LANGUAGE)"
  ],
  "game_state_indicators": {
    // (string: boolean/string) Key-value pairs for game state flags.
    "naval_encounter_imminent": false // Mandatory: reset the flag as the encounter is now "active" not "imminent".
   },
    "input_placeholder": "string (A short, context-aware, and subtle hint for the player's next input. Must be in ${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()})"
}

**INPUT_PLACEHOLDER GUIDANCE:**
Always provide a short, subtle input_placeholder string in the NARRATIVE LANGUAGE (${currentNarrativeLanguage.toUpperCase()}).
This placeholder must not reference or suggest any specific action or path.
It should evoke the inner state, sensory mood, or atmosphere of the scene without implying intent, decision, or direction.
Keep it under 50 characters, emotionally or descriptively rich, and entirely non-directive.
Do not echo the available actions. Do not hint at a goal. Do not resolve ambiguity—let it breathe.


This prompt is about that heart-stopping moment when the unknown appears on the vast ocean. Is it an opportunity for plunder, a deadly threat, or a mysterious omen? Make the Captain lean forward, spyglass in hand, every sense alert. Give them goosebumps as they weigh their first critical move.
