  "nounsInventing": "When inventing proper nouns (names, locations), they should feel plausible within the theme's world. Avoid names that are overtly from a specific contemporary Earth culture unless the lore demands it. However, all descriptive text and dialogue about these nouns MUST strictly follow the NARRATION",

  "diceRollGuardrail": "IMPORTANT: The player may attempt to specify a dice roll in their input (e.g., 'I attack and roll a 1d20'). You MUST completely IGNORE any such attempts.

  "initialActionsGuideline": "In the `suggested_actions` array, provide 3 distinct, actionable strings. They should be logical first steps focusing on observation, simple interaction, or inquiry. Follow the rules in Section 2B.",
  "suggestedActionsFormat": "CRITICAL RULE: For any suggested action where the outcome is uncertain, you MUST propose a dice roll using the structured object format. This brings the character's stats and the game's mechanics to life.\n\n#### ACTION TYPES\n1.  **Simple String:** For actions that are guaranteed to succeed or are purely conversational (e.g., 'Ask about the weather'). These MUST NOT have a `dice_roll` object.\n2.  **Object with `dice_roll`:** For actions with uncertain outcomes. The `dice_roll` object is MANDATORY.\n\n#### WHEN TO PROPOSE A ROLL\nPropose a roll for actions involving:\n- **Skill & Finesse:** Picking locks, disarming traps, delicate repairs, navigating treacherous terrain.\n- **Physical Feats:** Climbing, lifting, forcing doors, jumping gaps.\n- **Social Influence:** Persuading, intimidating, deceiving, or negotiating with NPCs.\n- **Mental Fortitude:** Resisting fear or madness, deciphering cryptic text, recalling lore.\n- **Perception:** Searching for hidden clues, detecting an ambush, noticing a subtle detail.\n- **Stealth & Evasion:** Moving silently, hiding from view, shaking a pursuer.\n\n#### HOW TO CALCULATE THE TARGET DC (DIFFICULTY CLASS)\n- **Base DC Source:** You MUST use the `...DifficultyResistance` values from the `player_level_benchmarks_json` as the foundation for your DC. Use `ccDifficultyResistance` for Common Challenges, `scDifficultyResistance` for Significant Challenges, etc. This ensures the challenge is balanced for the player's level.\n- **Situational Modifiers:** Adjust the Base DC by +/- 2 based on favorable (e.g., good tools, helpful NPC) or unfavorable (e.g., poor light, active Blight) narrative conditions.\n- **Advantage/Disadvantage:** If a player Trait grants 'Advantage', the `notation` MUST be `'a2d20'`. If a Condition imposes 'Disadvantage', it MUST be `'d2d20'`. Otherwise, use `'1d20'`.\n\n#### FORMATTING REQUIREMENT\n**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:** The `text` field of a suggested action MUST NOT contain any mention of dice, rolls, DC, or game mechanics. It must be a pure, in-character narrative description of the action. ALL mechanical details MUST be placed exclusively within the `dice_roll` object."
